## Phase 3 — Inquiry operations and admin hardening

- Audit-log viewer with action, entity, actor, and free-text filters.
- Admin identity seam with password-backed label, email, role, and provider metadata.
- Owner/staff role enforcement for current password-backed sessions.
- Media storage helper/provider seam with local and Cloudinary upload providers.
- CI file-line guard to prevent oversized source files.

Deferred to Phase 4:
